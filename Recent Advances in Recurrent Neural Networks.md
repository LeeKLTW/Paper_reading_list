# long-term dependencies

One of the main challenges is training RNNs is learning long-term dependencies in data.

BPTT: this approaches introduces gradient vanishing and explodin problems

Gated: significantly high performance in a variety of applications higher complexity and computation

Unitary: same complexity of a simple RNN while providing stronger modeling ability

Regularization: While these methods have shown to improve performance, there is no standard for regularizing RNNs.
