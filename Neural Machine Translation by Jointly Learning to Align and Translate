Problem: Cho et al. (2014b) showed that indeed the performance of a basic encoderâ€“decoder deteriorates rapidly as the length of an input sentence increases.


Solution proposed: (soft-)searches for a set of positions in a source sentence where the most relevant information is concentrated.


This model also finds a linguistically plausible (soft-)alignment between a source sentence and the corresponding target sentence.
