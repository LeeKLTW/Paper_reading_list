Traditional feature-rich systems are being replaced by end-to-end neural networks. One maypoint to two trends.
1. push back against the abandonment of linguistic knowledge and call for incorporating it inside the networks in different ways.
2. strive to better understand how neural language processing models work.


interpretability in machine learning
+ accountability, trust, fairness, safety, and reliability
- performance


# 2. What linguistic information is captured in neural networks
the trained model is used for generating feature representations for another task by running it on corpus
