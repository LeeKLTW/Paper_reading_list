# 1. Intro
## Traditional feature-rich systems are being replaced by end-to-end neural networks. One maypoint to two trends.

1. push back against the abandonment of linguistic knowledge and call for incorporating it inside the networks in different ways.
2. strive to better understand how neural language processing models work.


## interpretability in machine learning

- pros: accountability, trust, fairness, safety, and reliability
- cons: performance

# 2. What linguistic information is captured in neural networks
## 2.1.the trained model is used for generating feature representations for another task by running it on corpus

## 2.2 Linguistic phenomena

1. While it is difficult to synthesize a holistic picture from this diverse body of work, it appears that neural networks are able to learn a substantial amount of information on various linguistic phenomena.
